- You will often find that you will need to interact with the user during a navigation operation, so that the user can confirm or cancel it. In many applications, for example, the user may try to navigate while in the middle of entering or editing data. In these situations, you may want to ask the user whether he or she wants to save or discard the data that has been entered before continuing to navigate away from the page, or whether the user wants to cancel the navigation operation altogether. Prism supports these scenarios via the IConfirmNavigationRequest interface.
- The IConfirmNavigationRequest interface derives from the INavigationAware interface and adds the ConfirmNavigationRequest method. By implementing this interface on your view or view model class, you allow them to participate in the navigation sequence in a way that allows them to interact with the user so that the user can confirm or cancel the navigation.
- The ConfirmNavigationRequest method provides two parameters, a reference to the current navigation context, **and a callback method that you can call when you want navigation to continue**. For this reason, the callback is known as a continuation callback.

- [[Technical Stuff/PRISM Framework/Notes from Samples/IConfirmNavigationRequest|To use this interface, simply let your view model class inherit it.]]
- **If you want to defer navigation, you can store a reference to the continuation callback you can then call when the interaction with the user (or web service) completes. The navigation operation will be pending until you call the continuation callback.**
- If the user initiates another navigation operation in the meantime, the navigation request then becomes canceled. In this case, calling the continuation callback has no effect because the navigation operation to which it relates is no longer current. Similarly, if you decide not to call the continuation callback, the navigation operation will be pending until it is replaced with a new navigation operation.
