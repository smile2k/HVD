- IContainerProvider is used during the runtime phase of the application, particularly in the OnInitialized method of the Prism Module. It provides methods for resolving instances from the container.
- The Resolve method of IContainerProvider is commonly used to obtain instances of registered types from the container.
```csharp
public class YourModule : IModule
{
    public void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry)
    {
        containerRegistry.Register<IMyService, MyServiceImpl>();
    }

    public void OnInitialized(IContainerProvider containerProvider)
    {
        // Use IContainerProvider to resolve instances
        var myService = containerProvider.Resolve<IMyService>();
    }
}

```
