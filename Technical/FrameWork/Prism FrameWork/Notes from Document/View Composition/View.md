- Views are the main unit of UI construction within a composite application. You can define a view as a user control, page, data template, or custom control. A view encapsulates a portion of your UI that you would like to keep as decoupled as possible from other parts of the application. You can choose what goes in a view based on encapsulation or a piece of functionality, or you can choose to define something as a view because you will have multiple instances of that view in your application.
- The easiest way to define a view is to define a user control. To add a view to the UI, you simply need a way to construct it and add it to a container. WPF provides mechanisms to do this. The Prism Library adds the ability to define a region into which a view can be dynamically added at run time.
